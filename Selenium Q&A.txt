1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
   Selenium is a free open-source automated testing framework used to validate web applications across
   different browsers and platforms. and we can use multiple languages like java, python, etx...
   components:
   Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
   Selenium Remote Control (RC)
   Selenium Grid
   WebDriver
         * which sends commands to a browser and retrieves results. 
    
2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
   Selenium Script creates an HTTP Request for each selenium command and sends it to the browser driver. An HTTP request is then 
   sent to the server using Browser Driver. The steps are executed on the HTTP server.
3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
   1.ID
   2.Name
   3.Class name
   4.LinkTest
   5.Partial link test
   6.Tag name 
   7.Selected css
   8.Xpath
4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
   Because id is the unique identifier for the element and it does not change.
   This makes ‘Ids’ a very explicit and reliable way to locate elements on the page.
   Also, all browsers also have highly efficient methods to get an object on the page using their ids.
5.How to select value in dropdown?
    WebElement findElement = driver.findElement(By.id("dropdown1"));
    Select dd1=new Select(findElement);
    dd1.selectByValue("2");

6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
                                 absolute                                          Relative
   By definition	specifies the location from the root directory	   related to the location from current directory
  
   Navigates to         we can use Content from other domains	           we can use Content from the same domain
7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
   public class CheckBox {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
		ChromeDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html");
		driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(30));
		driver.manage().window().maximize();
		
		System.out.println( driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//input[@type='checkbox'])[8]")).isSelected());
		
	}

}
   
8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
  WebDriverManager automates the browser setup in the Selenium code. By default, 
it downloads the latest version of the browser binary and also the binary for the appropriate platform.
	setProperty method is used to configure the browser driver path.
  
9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
   
   preceeding:
	   Xpath= //*[@attribute='value']//preceding::input
   following:
           Xpath=//*[@attribute='value']//following:: input
   
10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
    The getAttribute() method helps to get the value of any attribute of a web element, which is returned as a String
